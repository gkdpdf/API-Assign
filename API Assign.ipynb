Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses.\n",

    "Dependency on Third-Party Developers: APIs rely on third-party developers to create applications that integrate with the software system. This can create dependencies that are outside of the control of the company that owns the software system.\n",
    "Governance and Management: APIs require proper governance and management to ensure they are being used correctly and consistently across different applications and systems."
